# Phase 0 Validation TODO

**Duration**: 1 month (2025-10-23 ~ 2025-11-23)  
**Cost**: $0 (Free)  
**Platform**: OpenCode + Grok Code Fast 1

## Week 1 (2025-10-23 ~ 2025-10-29)

### Setup & Initial Validation
- [x] Install OpenCode
- [x] Configure Grok Code Fast 1
- [x] Create ForgeMind folder structure
- [ ] First Facilitator Agent conversation
- [ ] Test basic Idea→Module flow
- [ ] Document initial findings

### Experiments
- [ ] Experiment 1: Facilitator Agent - Can it understand 5-layer structure?
- [ ] Experiment 2: Discovery conversation - Can it ask right questions?
- [ ] Experiment 3: Clarify phase - Can it identify ambiguities?

## Week 2 (2025-10-30 ~ 2025-11-05)

### Core Agent Validation
- [ ] Verify BA Agent capabilities
- [ ] Verify Architect Agent capabilities
- [ ] Test Module identification
- [ ] Test Domain identification
- [ ] Document pain points

### Experiments
- [ ] Experiment 4: BA Agent - Can it collect requirements in EARS format?
- [ ] Experiment 5: Architect Agent - Can it design module structure?
- [ ] Experiment 6: Cross-layer navigation - Can it move between layers?

## Week 3 (2025-11-06 ~ 2025-11-12)

### Non-Linear Testing
- [ ] Test backtracking from Requirement to Idea
- [ ] Test Module dependency management
- [ ] Test simple Impact Analysis
- [ ] Accumulate Agent prompts
- [ ] Test Anti-Hallucination checks

### Experiments
- [ ] Experiment 7: Non-linear backtrack - Can it handle changes?
- [ ] Experiment 8: Impact Analysis - Can it identify impacts?
- [ ] Experiment 9: Anti-Hallucination - Does it prevent fabrication?

## Week 4 (2025-11-13 ~ 2025-11-23)

### Evaluation & Decision
- [ ] Compile findings
- [ ] Write Phase 0 validation report
- [ ] Identify improvements needed
- [ ] Boss decision: Proceed to Phase 1?

### Success Criteria
- [ ] ✅ AI understands 5-layer structure
- [ ] ✅ Can handle simple backtracking
- [ ] ⭕ Terminal workflow acceptable
- [ ] ⭕ Agent prompt quality high

# Phase 0 Validation TODO

**Duration**: 1 month (2025-10-23 ~ 2025-11-23)
**Cost**: $0 (Free)
**Focus**: Validate ForgeMind implementation concepts

## Week 1 (2025-10-23 ~ 2025-10-29)

### Foundation Establishment (Priority: Address Core Pain Points)
- [x] Install OpenCode
- [x] Configure Grok Code Fast 1
- [x] Create ForgeMind folder structure
- [x] First Facilitator Agent conversation
- [x] Test basic Idea→Module flow
- [x] Establish Constitution with Agent Discipline principle
- [x] Implement Anti-Hallucination framework
- [ ] Document initial findings (Idea→Module flow successful, Constitution established)

### Experiments (Foundation First)
- [x] Experiment 1: Facilitator Agent - Can it understand 5-layer structure?
- [ ] Experiment 2: Agent Discipline - Can agents follow constitution rules?
- [ ] Experiment 3: Anti-Hallucination - Does constitution prevent fabrication?

## Week 2 (2025-10-30 ~ 2025-11-05)

### Constitution Validation (Priority: Test Foundation)
- [ ] Test Constitution compliance across all agents
- [ ] Validate Agent Discipline implementation
- [ ] Test Anti-Hallucination checks in practice
- [ ] Document constitution effectiveness

### Core Agent Validation (After Foundation)
- [ ] Verify BA Agent capabilities (with discipline checks)
- [ ] Verify Architect Agent capabilities (with discipline checks)
- [ ] Test Module identification (constitution-compliant)
- [ ] Test Domain identification (constitution-compliant)

## Week 3 (2025-11-06 ~ 2025-11-12)

### Advanced Validation (With Constitution Foundation)
- [ ] Test backtracking from Requirement to Idea (discipline-maintained)
- [ ] Test Module dependency management (constitution-compliant)
- [ ] Test simple Impact Analysis (anti-hallucination validated)
- [ ] Accumulate Agent prompts (discipline principles included)

### Experiments (Constitution-Proven)
- [ ] Experiment 7: Non-linear backtrack - Can it handle changes?
- [ ] Experiment 8: Impact Analysis - Can it identify impacts?
- [ ] Experiment 9: Constitution Effectiveness - Does it maintain discipline?

## Week 4 (2025-11-13 ~ 2025-11-23)

### Evaluation & Decision
- [ ] Compile findings
- [ ] Write Phase 0 validation report
- [ ] Identify improvements needed
- [ ] Boss decision: Proceed to Phase 1 (MVP Build)?

### Success Criteria
- [x] ✅ Constitution established with Agent Discipline principle
- [ ] ✅ AI follows constitution rules (no undisciplined behavior)
- [ ] ✅ Anti-Hallucination framework prevents fabrication
- [ ] ✅ AI understands 5-layer structure
- [ ] ✅ Can handle simple backtracking
- [ ] ⭕ Terminal workflow acceptable
- [ ] ⭕ Agent prompt quality high

## Notes & Discoveries

### 2025-10-23
- Setup completed
- First Facilitator Agent conversation completed
- Clarity increased: 85% → 92% (+7%)
- Identified 6 core pain points (AI discipline and hallucinations prioritized)
- Constitution established with Agent Discipline principle
- Two-tier agent architecture documented
- Clarified target users, success metrics, technology scope, integration approach
- Learning log created and committed

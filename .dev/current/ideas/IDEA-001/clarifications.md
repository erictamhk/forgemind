### Q4: What should be the primary technology scope for ForgeMind?

**Options:**
A. Enterprise applications only (web apps, APIs, microservices)
B. Broad software development (including mobile, desktop, embedded)
C. AI agent frameworks and tooling (focus on the ForgeMind platform itself)
D. Full-stack development automation (from idea to deployment)
E. Other (please specify)

**Answer:** E. Other (all kinds of software, focus on ForgeMind + enterprise apps)

**Recorded:** Technology scope includes all kinds of software, but current focus is building ForgeMind itself. Primary focus on enterprise applications: web apps, mobile apps, tablet apps, with backend services.

**Clarity Impact:** 55% → 70%

### Q5: Which of the three core modules should we prioritize for initial implementation?

**Options:**
A. Agent Orchestration Engine (coordinates 68+ AI agents)
B. Knowledge & Artifact Management (5-layer structure, traceability)
C. Quality Assurance & Validation (anti-hallucination checks, quality gates)
D. All three equally (parallel development)
E. Other (please specify)

**Answer:** D. All three equally (parallel development)

**Recorded:** All three core modules should be developed in parallel: Agent Orchestration Engine, Knowledge & Artifact Management, and Quality Assurance & Validation.

**Clarity Impact:** 70% → 80%

### Q6: What makes ForgeMind different from other AI coding tools?

**Options:**
A. Constitution-governed agents with strict discipline
B. Boss-mode interface for non-technical users
C. 6-layer development structure with clarity tracking
D. Two-tier agent system (system + project agents)
E. Zero technical debt and anti-hallucination guarantees
F. All of the above (comprehensive differentiation)
G. Other (please specify)

**Answer:** A. Constitution-governed agents with strict discipline

**Recorded:** ForgeMind's key differentiator is constitution-governed agents with strict discipline, ensuring consistent, hallucination-free development.

**Clarity Impact:** 80% → 85%

### Q7: What should be the pricing and business model for ForgeMind?

**Options:**
A. Freemium model ($0 basic, paid for advanced features)
B. Progressive investment ($0 → $80 → $960 → unlimited)
C. Subscription-based (monthly/annual tiers)
D. Project-based pricing (per project or per hour)
E. Open source core with commercial extensions
F. Other (please specify)

**Answer:** F. Other (open source project)

**Recorded:** Business model should be open source project, making ForgeMind freely available as open source software.

**Clarity Impact:** 85% → 90%

### Q8: Now that IDEA clarity has reached 90%, should we proceed to Layer 1 (MODULE)?

**Options:**
A. Yes - Proceed to MODULE layer immediately
B. Yes - But first create a version snapshot of the clarified IDEA
C. No - Need more clarification on IDEA details
D. No - Want to backtrack and change something in IDEA

**Answer:** B. Yes - But first create a version snapshot of the clarified IDEA

**Recorded:** Proceed to Layer 1 (MODULE) after creating version snapshot v0.4.0.

**Clarity Impact:** Maintained at 90%, ready for next layer

### Additional Clarification: ForgeMind as Framework + Agent Library

**Context:** Post-Layer 0 completion, clarifying the core ForgeMind concept.

**Question:** What is the fundamental nature of ForgeMind?

**Answer:** ForgeMind is a framework/toolkit for existing AI tools that also provides 68 agents written as markdown files. AI tools (OpenCode, Claude Code, etc.) call these markdown agents for disciplined development processes. The facilitator-agent is one such markdown agent that coordinates the overall process.

**Recorded:** ForgeMind provides:
1. Framework/toolkit for existing AI agent tools
2. 68 agents defined as markdown files that AI tools can call
3. Integration protocols and guidelines for disciplined development
4. Facilitator-agent as a markdown agent for coordination

**Impact:** Shifts from standalone system to framework + agent library approach.

**Clarity Impact:** 90% → 95% (better alignment with implementation approach)

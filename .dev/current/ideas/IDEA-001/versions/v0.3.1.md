# IDEA-001: ForgeMind System

> **Version**: v0.3.1
> **Status**: Clarified
> **Clarity**: 95%

## Vision

ForgeMind is an AI agent system where **you (Boss) provide the business idea, and AI agents do all the technical work**. The Facilitator Agent coordinates a team of specialized AI agents and sub-agents to handle every aspect of software development - from requirements to code generation to testing.

You tell your idea to the Facilitator Agent, and it calls the right agents (BA for requirements, Architect for design, Domain Expert for business logic, etc.) to execute the work. Version control tracks project growth and maintains consistency.

## Goals

1. **Boss Mode** - You provide business decisions, AI agents handle all technical complexity through coordinated teamwork
2. **Agent Collaboration** - Facilitator orchestrates 68+ specialized agents and sub-agents for complete development automation
3. **Non-Linear Development** - Backtrack any layer anytime, 3-second Impact Analysis
4. **Zero Technical Debt** - AI auto-maintains consistency, bidirectional traceability
5. **Quality Assurance** - 21+ Anti-Hallucination checks prevent AI errors
6. **Progressive Investment** - $0 → $80 → $960 → as needed

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Small business owners who can't afford full development teams + Technical founders who want to accelerate development
- **Secondary**: Developers needing assistance with new projects, refactoring legacy code, or adding/changing features

## Pain Points

1. **Vague ideas and insufficient requirements**
2. **Lack of domain experts**
3. **AI code generation without rules** (disordered code due to insufficient understanding)
4. **Cumbersome change management** (knowledge, ideas, specs, requirements, tech stack changes)
5. **Premature decisions** making software hard to change
6. **AI hallucinations and quality control** issues in code generation

## Success Metrics

- Time saved per project (e.g., 50% faster development)
- Cost reduction percentage (e.g., 70% lower development costs)
- Code quality scores (maintainability, bug rates)
- User satisfaction ratings (Boss and developer feedback)
- Project completion rates (percentage of projects finished on time)
- Clarity level improvements (idea clarity progression)
- **Plus**: Excellent change management with comprehensive records for all artifacts (knowledge, ideas, specifications, requirements, etc.)

## Technology Scope

- **Primary focus**: Enterprise applications
- **Includes**: Web apps, mobile apps, APIs, microservices, and other enterprise systems

## Integration Points

- **Git repository integration** (simplified, tracks project growth and version control)
- **CI/CD, IDE, and other integrations**: Not considered for initial phases

## Modules

- **MODULE-001**: Core Framework (5-layer, traceability, anti-hallucination)
- **MODULE-002**: Agent System (68 agents collaboration)
- **MODULE-003**: Boss Dashboard (UI, decision interface)

## Current Status

- Layer 0 (Idea): 95% clarity ← **We are here!**
- Planning phase: ✅ Complete
- Clarification phase: ✅ Complete
- Ready for: Phase 0 Validation

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 0: Validation** (Current - 1 month)

- Validate core ForgeMind concepts
- Test Idea→Module→Domain→Requirement→Spec flow
- Verify agent system works

**Phase 1: MVP Build** (2 months)

- Implement minimum viable ForgeMind
- Core framework, agent system, boss dashboard
- Test with simple projects

**Phase 2: Enhancement** (3 months)

- Add advanced features
- Improve UI/UX
- Scale to enterprise use

**Phase 3: Production Use** (Ongoing)

- Use ForgeMind for client projects
- Continuous improvement
- Revenue generation

## Next Steps

1. Test Idea→Module flow (in progress)
2. Verify Facilitator Agent
3. Verify BA Agent
4. Verify Architect Agent
5. Test non-linear backtracking
6. Accumulate Agent prompts

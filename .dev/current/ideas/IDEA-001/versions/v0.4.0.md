# IDEA-001: ForgeMind System (Version Snapshot v0.4.0)

> **Version**: v0.4.0
> **Status**: Ready for Layer 1 (MODULE)
> **Clarity**: 90%
> **Snapshot Date**: 2025-10-27
> **Reason**: Clarification session completed, 90% clarity achieved

## Vision

ForgeMind is a **constitution-governed AI agent system** where **you (Boss) provide the business idea, and disciplined AI agents do all the technical work following Plan → Ask → Execute processes**. The Facilitator Agent coordinates a team of specialized AI agents and sub-agents to handle every aspect of software development - from requirements to code generation to testing.

You tell your idea to the Facilitator Agent, and it calls the right agents (BA for requirements, Architect for design, Domain Expert for business logic, etc.) to execute the work. All agents strictly adhere to constitution principles, ensuring disciplined, hallucination-free development. Version control tracks project growth and maintains consistency.

## Goals

1. **Boss Mode** - You provide business decisions, AI agents handle all technical complexity through coordinated teamwork
2. **Agent Collaboration** - Facilitator orchestrates 68+ specialized agents and sub-agents for complete development automation
3. **Constitution Compliance** - All agents strictly adhere to project-principles.md governance rules
4. **Disciplined Process** - Plan → Ask → Execute ensures deliberate, approved actions
5. **Agent Discipline** - Strict adherence to defined roles prevents undisciplined behavior
6. **Two-Tier Agent System** - ForgeMind system agents + project-specific domain experts
7. **Non-Linear Development** - Backtrack any layer anytime, 3-second Impact Analysis
8. **Zero Technical Debt** - AI auto-maintains consistency, bidirectional traceability
9. **Quality Assurance** - 21+ Anti-Hallucination checks prevent AI errors
10. **Progressive Investment** - $0 → $80 → $960 → as needed

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Small business owners who can't afford full development teams + Technical founders who want to accelerate development
- **Secondary**: Developers needing assistance with new projects, refactoring legacy code, or adding/changing features

## Pain Points

1. **Vague ideas and insufficient requirements**
2. **Lack of domain experts**
3. **AI lack of discipline** (not following rules, disordered code, inconsistent behavior)
4. **Cumbersome change management** (knowledge, ideas, specs, requirements, tech stack changes)
5. **Premature decisions** making software hard to change
6. **AI hallucinations and quality control** issues in code generation

## Success Metrics

- Time saved per project (e.g., 50% faster development)
- Cost reduction percentage (e.g., 70% lower development costs)
- Code quality scores (maintainability, bug rates)
- User satisfaction ratings (Boss and developer feedback)
- Project completion rates (percentage of projects finished on time)
- Clarity level improvements (idea clarity progression)
- **Plus**: Excellent change management with comprehensive records for all artifacts (knowledge, ideas, specifications, requirements, etc.)

## Technology Scope

- **Primary focus**: Enterprise applications
- **Includes**: Web apps, mobile apps, APIs, microservices, and other enterprise systems

## Integration Points

- **Git repository integration** (simplified, tracks project growth and version control)
- **CI/CD, IDE, and other integrations**: Not considered for initial phases

## Constitution Foundation

ForgeMind is built on a constitution-based governance framework (project-principles.md) that ensures:

- **Agent Discipline**: All agents follow defined roles and principles strictly
- **Disciplined Process**: Plan → Ask → Execute for all operations
- **Constitution Compliance**: Continuous validation against governance rules
- **Two-Tier Architecture**: System agents (ForgeMind) + Project agents (domain experts)
- **Anti-Hallucination**: Framework prevents AI fabrication and errors

## Modules

- **MODULE-001**: Agent Orchestration Engine (coordinate 68+ AI agents and sub-agents with constitution compliance)
- **MODULE-002**: Knowledge & Artifact Management (5-layer structure, traceability, impact analysis with disciplined processes)
- **MODULE-003**: Quality Assurance & Validation (21+ anti-hallucination checks, quality gates, constitution validation)

## Current Status

- Layer 0 (Idea): 90% clarity ✅ **Complete - Ready for Layer 1**
- Planning phase: ✅ Complete
- Clarification phase: ✅ Complete (8 questions answered)
- Current: Ready for Layer 1 (MODULE) - System Architecture Definition



## Next Steps

1. Re-evaluate implementation approach
2. Align with original goals

## MVP Definition

### Communication Rules
- **Boss ↔ Facilitator only**: Agents never contact Boss directly
- **Facilitator gathers info**: Collects updates from BA/Architect/QA, reports to Boss
- **Boss approvals required**: All updates need Boss permission via Facilitator
- **Meeting records**: All agent interactions logged for traceability

### Success Criteria
- Constitution compliance: All agents follow project-principles.md rules
- Zero hallucinations: 21+ anti-hallucination checks prevent AI errors
- Disciplined process: Plan → Ask → Execute for all operations
- Boss control: Only Facilitator communicates with Boss
- Quality gates: Each phase validated before proceeding
- Traceability: Meeting records maintain audit trail
- Non-linear support: Backtrack any layer anytime with 3-second impact analysis

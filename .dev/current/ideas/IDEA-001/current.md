# IDEA-001: ForgeMind System

> **Version**: v0.3.0
> **Status**: Clarified
> **Clarity**: 92%

## Vision

ForgeMind is an AI-driven software development system that enables **non-technical Boss** to manage entire development process with only 1-2 hours daily investment.

## Goals

1. **Boss Mode** - Boss provides business decisions, AI handles all technical complexity
2. **Non-Linear Development** - Backtrack any layer anytime, 3-second Impact Analysis
3. **Zero Technical Debt** - AI auto-maintains consistency, bidirectional traceability
4. **Quality Assurance** - 21+ Anti-Hallucination checks
5. **Progressive Investment** - $0 → $80 → $960 → as needed

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Small business owners who can't afford full development teams + Technical founders who want to accelerate development
- **Secondary**: Developers needing assistance with new projects, refactoring legacy code, or adding/changing features

## Pain Points

1. **Vague ideas and insufficient requirements**
2. **Lack of domain experts**
3. **AI code generation without rules** (disordered code due to insufficient understanding)
4. **Cumbersome change management** (knowledge, ideas, specs, requirements, tech stack changes)
5. **Premature decisions** making software hard to change
6. **AI hallucinations and quality control** issues in code generation

## Success Metrics

- Time saved per project (e.g., 50% faster development)
- Cost reduction percentage (e.g., 70% lower development costs)
- Code quality scores (maintainability, bug rates)
- User satisfaction ratings (Boss and developer feedback)
- Project completion rates (percentage of projects finished on time)
- Clarity level improvements (idea clarity progression)
- **Plus**: Excellent change management with comprehensive records for all artifacts (knowledge, ideas, specifications, requirements, etc.)

## Technology Scope

- **Primary focus**: Enterprise applications
- **Includes**: Web apps, mobile apps, APIs, microservices, and other enterprise systems

## Integration Points

- **Git repository integration** (simplified, without complex workflows or branching)
- **CI/CD, IDE, and other integrations**: Not considered for initial phases

## Modules

- **MODULE-001**: Core Framework (5-layer, traceability, anti-hallucination)
- **MODULE-002**: Agent System (68 agents collaboration)
- **MODULE-003**: Boss Dashboard (UI, decision interface)

## Current Status

- Layer 0 (Idea): 92% clarity ← **We are here!**
- Planning phase: ✅ Complete
- Clarification phase: ✅ Complete
- Ready for: Phase 0 Validation

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 0: Validation** (Current - 1 month)
- Validate core ForgeMind concepts
- Test Idea→Module→Domain→Requirement→Spec flow
- Verify agent system works

**Phase 1: MVP Build** (2 months)
- Implement minimum viable ForgeMind
- Core framework, agent system, boss dashboard
- Test with simple projects

**Phase 2: Enhancement** (3 months)
- Add advanced features
- Improve UI/UX
- Scale to enterprise use

**Phase 3: Production Use** (Ongoing)
- Use ForgeMind for client projects
- Continuous improvement
- Revenue generation

## Next Steps

1. Test Idea→Module flow (in progress)
2. Verify Facilitator Agent
3. Verify BA Agent
4. Verify Architect Agent
5. Test non-linear backtracking
6. Accumulate Agent prompts

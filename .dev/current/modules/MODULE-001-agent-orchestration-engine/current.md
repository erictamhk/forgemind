# MODULE-001: Agent Library & Integration Framework

> **Version**: v1.1.0
> **Status**: Updated for Framework Approach
> **Parent Idea**: IDEA-001

## Purpose

Generate and orchestrate AI agents as **Anthropic Agent Skills** following a **Two-Tier Architecture**:

- **System Agents (ForgeMind)**: Generate the core 68 specialized AI agents as complete filesystem packages
- **Project Agents (Domain Experts)**: Dynamically generate domain-specific agent skills per project

All agents are complete filesystem packages with SKILL.md files, YAML metadata, progressive disclosure (3-level loading), and supporting scripts that existing AI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Codex) can load and call. Includes multi-tool integration protocols, templates, and guidelines that enable AI tools to follow constitution-governed, disciplined development processes.

## Two-Tier Agent Architecture

ForgeMind implements a **Two-Tier Agent System**:

### System Agents (ForgeMind Core)
- **Pre-built**: 68 specialized agents that are part of the ForgeMind framework
- **Standardized**: Follow consistent Agent Skill specifications
- **Universal**: Work across all projects and domains
- **Examples**: Facilitator, BA, Architect, Domain Expert, Requirements Engineer, QA, etc.

### Project Agents (Domain Experts)
- **Dynamic**: Generated on-demand for specific project domains
- **Contextual**: Tailored to project-specific business domains
- **Flexible**: Adapt to unique project requirements
- **Examples**: HR Domain Expert (for HRMS), Manufacturing Domain Expert (for MRP), Finance Domain Expert (for ERP), etc.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Agent Coordination**: Manage communication between Facilitator and specialized agents
2. **Workflow Management**: Orchestrate complex multi-agent workflows for development tasks
3. **Task Delegation**: Automatically assign tasks to appropriate agents based on expertise
4. **State Management**: Track agent execution status and coordinate handoffs
5. **Error Handling**: Manage agent failures and provide fallback strategies

## Core Components

### Skill Packaging & Progressive Disclosure

- Generate complete Agent Skill packages with SKILL.md, YAML frontmatter, and supporting files
- Implement 3-level progressive disclosure (metadata → instructions → resources)
- Create supporting documentation (CONTEXT.md, COMMANDS.md, PLAN_ASK_EXECUTE.md)
- Package executable scripts and resource templates
- Validate skill compliance with Agent Skill Specification

### Agent Registry

- Maintain catalog of all 68+ agent skills and their capabilities
- Agent metadata management (YAML frontmatter, expertise areas, dependencies)
- Dynamic agent skill discovery and registration

### Workflow Engine

- Define and execute multi-step agent workflows using both system and project agents
- Handle parallel and sequential agent execution across the 3 agent levels
- Dynamic workflow adaptation when project agents are spawned
- Workflow state persistence and recovery for interrupted sessions
- Task delegation based on agent expertise and prompt-defined roles
- Disciplined process integration: Plan → Ask → Execute validation
- Constitution compliance checks before workflow execution
- Agent discipline enforcement in parallel/sequential execution

### Communication Bus

- Standardized messaging protocol between agents for seamless collaboration
- Context sharing and data transfer across agent sessions
- Event-driven architecture for agent interactions and handoffs
- Integration with Boss (human) communication channels

### Orchestration Logic

- Decision algorithms for task-agent matching based on agent prompts and expertise
- Load balancing across available agents (considering prompt complexity)
- Priority and dependency management for multi-agent workflows
- Agent selection based on role definitions and current context
- Constitution compliance validation for all agent assignments
- Disciplined process enforcement in task delegation
- Agent discipline monitoring in orchestration decisions

## Domains

- **DOMAIN-001**: Agent Coordination (core orchestration logic)
- **DOMAIN-002**: Workflow Management (process definition and execution)
- **DOMAIN-003**: Communication Protocols (agent messaging standards)

## Dependencies

- **None** (This is the foundational orchestration layer)

## Depended By

- **MODULE-002**: Knowledge & Artifact Management (uses orchestration for artifact processing)
- **MODULE-003**: Quality Assurance & Validation (uses orchestration for validation workflows)
- **All future modules** requiring agent coordination

## Technical Architecture

To create a new ForgeMind system agent:
1. Define agent role and expertise area
2. Write detailed prompt with commands, principles, and capabilities (including constitution compliance)
3. Save prompt in appropriate level folder (`.ai/agents/prompts/level-X/`)
4. Register agent in orchestration system with constitution validation
5. Test agent integration and disciplined behavior

### Project Agent Generation (Domain Experts)
To generate project-specific domain experts:
1. Analyze project domain and requirements
2. Identify needed expertise areas (HR, manufacturing, finance, etc.)
3. Generate specialized prompts based on domain knowledge (constitution-compliant)
4. Spawn agents with project-specific context and discipline enforcement

# MODULE-002: Knowledge & Artifact Management

> **Version**: v1.1.0
> **Status**: Updated for Framework Approach
> **Parent Idea**: IDEA-001

## Purpose

Manage the complete 5-layer structure, maintain bidirectional traceability, and provide 3-second impact analysis within the ForgeMind framework. This module handles the "zero technical debt" and "non-linear development" capabilities by tracking all artifacts created when AI tools load and use ForgeMind's markdown agents, maintaining consistency across AI tool sessions and agent calls.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **5-Layer Structure Management**: Maintain Idea/Module/Domain/Requirement/Specification layers
2. **Artifact Lifecycle**: Create, update, version, and archive all project artifacts
3. **Traceability Matrix**: Maintain bidirectional links between all artifacts
4. **Impact Analysis**: Provide instant impact assessment for any changes
5. **Version Control Integration**: Seamless Git integration for artifact versioning

## Core Components

### Artifact Repository

- Centralized storage for all 5-layer artifacts created by AI tools using ForgeMind markdown agents
- Version management and history tracking for agent-generated content across AI tool sessions
- Metadata management including markdown agent source, AI tool used, creation context, and validation status
- Artifact relationship mapping across layers and agent contributions from different AI tools
- Constitution compliance validation for all stored artifacts
- Markdown agent discipline tracking in metadata (which specific agent was loaded)
- Disciplined process logging for artifact lifecycle events within AI tool sessions

### Traceability Engine

- Master traceability matrix maintenance linking agent actions to artifacts
- Bidirectional link management between requirements, specs, and implementations
- Dependency graph generation showing agent collaboration patterns
- Impact propagation algorithms for changes initiated by agents
- Constitution-based relationship validation
- Disciplined process enforcement in traceability operations
- Agent discipline monitoring in bidirectional links

### Impact Analysis System

- 3-second impact assessment for changes proposed by AI agents
- Ripple effect analysis across layers showing affected artifacts
- Change recommendation engine considering agent capabilities
- Risk assessment and mitigation suggestions for agent-initiated changes

### Version Control Integration
- Git repository management
- Artifact synchronization
- Conflict resolution
- Branch and merge support

### Session Management
- AI tool session tracking (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode sessions)
- Markdown agent loading history (which agents were used in each session)
- Cross-session artifact relationships and consistency validation
- Session-based artifact grouping for multi-tool development workflows

## Domains

- **DOMAIN-001**: Artifact Management (storage and lifecycle)
- **DOMAIN-002**: Traceability System (relationships and links)
- **DOMAIN-003**: Impact Analysis (change assessment)

## Dependencies

- **MODULE-001**: Agent Library & Integration Framework (uses framework protocols for analysis tasks)

## Depended By

- **MODULE-003**: Quality Assurance & Validation (validates managed artifacts)
- **All modules** requiring artifact access and traceability
- **Future reporting and analytics** systems

## Technical Architecture

### Key Interfaces
- `ArtifactRepository`: Artifact storage and retrieval
- `TraceabilityMatrix`: Relationship management
- `ImpactAnalyzer`: Change impact assessment
- `VersionController`: Git integration service

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Manages 1000+ artifacts with full traceability
- [ ] Provides impact analysis in < 3 seconds
- [ ] Maintains bidirectional links automatically
- [ ] Supports non-linear navigation across all layers
- [ ] Integrates seamlessly with Git workflows

## Current Status

- Layer 1 (Module): ✅ Defined
- Ready for: Domain definition and artifact schema design

## Constitution Integration

- Validates artifact management against constitution rules
- Enforces disciplined process in traceability operations
- Ensures agent discipline in knowledge management
- Integrates anti-hallucination checks for artifact validation

## Agent Integration

- Tracks which AI agents created/modified each artifact
- Maintains agent accountability and contribution history
- Provides context for agent decision-making and validation
- Supports agent learning from past artifacts and decisions
- Enforces constitution compliance in agent operations
- Validates agent discipline in artifact management

## Next Steps

1. Define DOMAIN-001: Artifact Management
2. Define DOMAIN-002: Traceability System
3. Define DOMAIN-003: Impact Analysis
4. Design artifact storage schemas with agent metadata
5. Implement traceability matrix algorithms
6. Create agent contribution tracking system

# MODULE-002: Framework Infrastructure

**Version**: v2.0.0
**Status**: Consolidated from MODULE-002 + MODULE-003
**Parent Idea**: IDEA-001

## Purpose

Provide comprehensive infrastructure support for the ForgeMind framework's 6-layer development structure, combining knowledge management, artifact lifecycle, quality assurance, and validation. This module ensures "zero technical debt", "non-linear development", and "anti-hallucination" guarantees by managing artifacts across all layers (IDEA→MODULE→DOMAIN→REQUIREMENT→SPECIFICATION→CODE), maintaining traceability, providing impact analysis, and enforcing quality standards across AI tool sessions.

## Key Responsibilities

### Context Engineering & Memory Management
1. **Context State Management**: Maintain current-context.json with real-time project state
2. **Intelligent Artifact Loading**: Load only relevant artifacts based on context (essential → task-specific → historical)
3. **Memory Persistence**: Update agent memory files (.forgemind/memory/) after each significant event
4. **Context Window Optimization**: Monitor and manage context usage (<70% threshold)
5. **Session Continuity**: Preserve context across AI tool sessions and agent interactions

### Knowledge & Artifact Management
6. **5-Layer Structure Management**: Maintain Idea/Module/Domain/Requirement/Specification layers
7. **Artifact Lifecycle**: Create, update, version, and archive all project artifacts from AI tool sessions
8. **Traceability Matrix**: Maintain bidirectional links between all artifacts
9. **Impact Analysis**: Provide 3-second impact assessment for changes
10. **Version Control Integration**: Seamless Git integration for artifact versioning

### Quality Assurance & Validation
11. **Anti-Hallucination Checks**: Implement 21+ validation patterns to prevent AI fabrication
12. **Quality Gates**: Automated quality assurance checkpoints for AI tool outputs
13. **Validation Engine**: Real-time validation of artifacts and constitution compliance
14. **Consistency Checking**: Ensure bidirectional traceability and artifact consistency
15. **Framework Compliance**: Validate adherence to ForgeMind protocols across AI tools

### Session Management
- AI tool session tracking (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode sessions)
- Markdown agent loading history (which agents were used in each session)
- Cross-session artifact relationships and consistency validation
- Session-based artifact grouping for multi-tool development workflows

### Anti-Hallucination Engine
- 21+ validation patterns to detect hallucinations in AI tool outputs using markdown agents
- 16+ technical failure cases applied to outputs from different AI tools
- Real-time hallucination detection during AI tool sessions with ForgeMind agents
- Automated correction suggestions for content generated by AI tools loading markdown agents
- Constitution compliance validation as primary check for framework usage
- Markdown agent discipline validation patterns and loading verification

### Quality Gate System
- Configurable quality checkpoints for AI tool outputs using ForgeMind agents
- Artifact validation rules tailored to markdown agent capabilities and AI tool types
- Approval workflow management for artifacts generated across different AI tools
- Quality metrics tracking across AI tools, agent types, and development sessions
- Constitution-based quality gates for framework compliance
- Markdown agent discipline enforcement and loading validation in quality checkpoints

### Framework Compliance Validation
- ForgeMind protocol adherence checking for AI tool integrations
- Markdown agent loading and usage validation across different AI tools
- Multi-tool session consistency validation and conflict detection
- Framework constitution compliance monitoring for AI tool outputs
- Cross-platform quality assurance for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Codex usage

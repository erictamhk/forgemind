## 🎯 Core Principles

### Agent Discipline
**All AI agents must be disciplined** - strictly following their defined roles, prompts, and principles. This addresses the core pain point of undisciplined AI behavior in coding and development.

### Boss Mode First
Business decisions from Boss, AI handles all technical complexity through coordinated agent teamwork.

### Zero Hallucination
AI agents must never fabricate information or deviate from documented facts and requirements.

### Non-Linear Development
Can backtrack to any layer anytime with 3-second impact analysis.

### Quality Assurance
21+ anti-hallucination checks ensure all outputs meet enterprise standards.
